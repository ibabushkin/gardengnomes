# What?
* `n` object files => a running process
  * a linker or a supervisor-like framework
* reloading one or more object files without stopping the process
  * a pure linker would make this hardish
    * we'd need to find everything from the object file, remap the
      address space to reflect the changes and fix pointers
  * a supervisor framework would `mmap` necessary regions and release
    the maps upon replacement. Managing pointers would still be needed
    * how do we want to keep track of things in general?
      * stack/heap
      * integration in `libc` and other dynamically linked components
        * passthrough seems to be the best option, but would require some
          trickery to find the patch data to use in relocations.
* a second process using `ptrace` and interrupting/hotpatching/whatever.

# Proposed handling of object files
* parse the object file for sections we care about and `mmap` the sections we
  will need using `MAP_PRIVATE` and `PROT_WRITE Â¦ PROT_READ`, apply
  relocations, and `mprotect` the pages to `PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC`.
